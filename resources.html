        <p>We strongly recommend typesetting solutions to homework in LaTeX. LaTeX is the standard for typesetting CS/math/etc papers, and will likely come in handy outside CS 161. As mentioned in the Policies section of the <a href="course-info.html">Course Info</a> page, to encourage you to typeset solutions in LaTeX, we will offer extra credit for typed submissions.
        <ul>
          <li><b>Example LaTeX solutions</b> See Homework 0 for an example of LaTeX'd problems and solutions. These solutions include examples of pseudocode in a few different environments, as well as examples of how to include images and figures.

          <li><b>Online Environments</b> If you don't want to install LaTeX, <a href="https://www.sharelatex.com/">ShareLaTeX</a> and <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> are online environments which compile previews of your LaTeX documents as you type. (They also allow you to share your LaTeX with others; but of course <a href="course-info.html">you won't be needing that feature</a> for this class!) Stanford students get a free OverLeaf Pro account.
          <li><b>LaTeX Editors</b> There are many LaTeX editors which allow you to use GUI to edit your LaTeX. <a href="https://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a> is a free one.
          <li><b>Finding symbols</b> <a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a> lets you draw the symbol that you are looking for and get LaTeX code.

        <p>
          We'll be using some Python here and there in the Homeworks and Tutorials to illustrate a few concepts. Required exercises will not need intimate understanding of the language, though some of the extra credit opportunities might require you code algorithms from scratch. Here are some resources to get you started.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Python 2 vs. Python 3</b> All examples and homework files in this class will use Python 3, which differs from Python 2 in a few important ways. (For example, integer division works differently). You can find a list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 <a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html">here</a>.
          <li><b>Python</b> You can a good Python tutorial <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming">here</a>.
          <li><b>IPython</b> IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most of using Python interactively. You can find IPython documentation <a href="http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">here</a>.
          <li><b>Jupyter</b> You can find Jupyter documentation <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a> and Jupyter installation instructions <a href="http://jupyter.org/install">here</a>.
          <li><b>In-line help</b> In the prompt in the Jupyter Notebook, if you type "help(x)" it will display a help page for x.

      <div class="homework">
        <h3 class="subheader">Homework Resources</h3>
        <p>Here are a few homework guidelines and pieces of advice that Prof. Mary Wootters gives to her CS 161 students, which also pertain to this offering.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Guidelines</b> One of the big skills you'll be developing in CS161 is how to communicate technical material clearly. To that end, we expect homework sets in CS161 to be clear, and easily human-readable. Think of them like memos you might write to a colleague. Better still, think of them as memos that you might write for a team of colleagues, who may be working quickly and also who have control over your grade.

          Your homeworks should be typed and clearly written with complete sentences and well-organized logic, and should definitely not be your first draft.

          When we ask for pseudocode, we are expecting pseudocode that is clear enough that a CS106B student (and certainly the grader) can understand what your algorithm is doing, and could implement it in a language of their choice, without thinking too hard. It is good practice to include an English description of what your pseudocode is doing, to help out the reader. See the example homework before for good and bad examples of pseudocode.

          <li><b>Homework 0</b> To help you get an idea of what we are expecting, Homework 0 is worth 0% of your grade and Homework 0 solutions will be released 7/3.

          <li><b>HW Tips</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Look at Homework 0 solutions for style advice.
            <li>Try to put yourself in the position of the reader. If you hadn't just been thinking about this problem for two hours, would your answer make sense to you?
            <li>The homework questions will always end with a text block explaining what sort of answer we expect. Read this text block carefully.
            <li>Start the homework early.
            <li>Try to "finish" the homework early, step away from it for a day, and then come back to it and read it over again. Chances are, you'll find some way to write what you've written more clearly.
            <li>If you get stuck, then ask for help from the course staff: come to office hours prepared to explain what you have tried, and why you are stuck.
